## Installation

1. Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Choose which TTS you want to use, `VoiceVox` or `Silero`. Uncomment and Comment to switch between them

```
# Choose between the available TTS engines
# Japanese TTS
voicevox_tts(tts)

# Silero TTS, Silero TTS can generate English, Russian, French, Hindi, Spanish, German, etc. Uncomment the line below. Make sure the input is in that language
# silero_tts(tts_en, "en", "v3_en", "en_21")
```

If you want to use VoiceVox, you need to run VoiceVox Engine first. You can run them on local using [VoiceVox Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/voicevox/voicevox_engine) or on Google Colab using [VoiceVox Colab](https://github.com/SociallyIneptWeeb/LanguageLeapAI/blob/main/src/run_voicevox_colab.ipynb). If you use the Colab one, change `voicevox_url` on `utils\TTS.py` using the link you get from Colab.

```
voicevox_url = 'http://localhost:50021'
```

if you want to see the voice list of VoiceVox you can check this [VoiceVox](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp) and see the speaker id on `speaker.json` then change it on `utils/TTS.py`. For Seliro Voice sample you can check this [Seliro Samples](https://oobabooga.github.io/silero-samples/index.html)

3. Choose which translator you want to use depends on your use case (optional if you need translation for the answers). Choose between google translate or deeplx. You need to convert the answer to Japanese if you want to use `VoiceVox`, because VoiceVox only accepts input in Japanese. 
```
tts = translate_deeplx(text, f"{detect}", "JA")
tts = translate_google(text, f"{detect}", "JA")
```

`DeepLx` is free version of `DeepL` (No API Key Required). You can run [Deeplx](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX) on docker, or if you want to use the normal version of deepl, you can make the function on `utils\translate.py`. I use `DeepLx` because i can't register on `DeepL` from my country. The translate result from `DeepL` is more accurate and casual than Google Translate. But if you want the simple way, just use Google Translate.

4. If you want to use the audio output from the program as an input for your `Vtubestudio`. You will need to capture your desktop audio using `Virtual Cable` and use it as input on VtubeStudio microphone.

5. If you planning to use this program for live streaming Use `en.txt` , `jap.txt` and `output.txt` as an input on OBS Text for Realtime Caption/Subtitles

## FAQ


1. Mecab Error

this library is a little bit tricky to install. If you facing this problem, you can just delete and don't use the `katakana_converter` on `utils/TTS.py`. That function is optional, you can run the program without it. Delete this two line on `utils/TTS.py`  

```
from utils.katakana import *
katakana_text = katakana_converter(tts)
```

and just pass the `tts` to next line of the code

```
params_encoded = urllib.parse.urlencode({'text': tts, 'speaker': 46})
```
